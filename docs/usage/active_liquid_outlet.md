# Active Liquid Outlet setup checklist

## What scripts usually write

- `On` (0/1)

## Minimum to work

- Powered
- Plumbed correctly for the outlet to move liquid where you expect
- Connected to the same data network as the IC Housing

## Common gotchas

- Many controllers only toggle `On`:
  - Configure any mode/target behavior in the device UI first.
