# Advanced Furnace setup checklist

## What scripts usually write

- `Activate` (0/1) for a short pulse

## Minimum to work

- Powered
- Connected to the same data network as the IC Housing

## Common gotchas

- Some scripts pulse `Activate` but do not toggle `On`:
  - Make sure the furnace is enabled/configured in-game so an `Activate` pulse actually does something.
