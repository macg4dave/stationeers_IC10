# _template (starter)

This folder is a **starter template** for creating new scripts in this repo.

- Copy this folder, rename it to your new script name, and rename the `.ic10` file to match.
- Keep the resulting script paste-ready (IC chip limits: 128 lines, 90 chars/line).

See also:

- `docs/ic10_script_checklist.md`
- `docs/usage/README.md` for device “gotchas” (Active Vent `On`+`Open`, etc.)
